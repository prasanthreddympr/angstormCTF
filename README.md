This challenge is from angstormCTF2023. There were 5000 links in a webpage and only one link has the valid flag. 
It is painstaking to click on each and every link manually and examine the contents of the url.
The script examines every link and prints out the content. 
We need the one valid link that has the flag. The url that has the valid flag was found in the number 3054.
